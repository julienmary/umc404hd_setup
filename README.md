# umc404hd_setup
Behringer UMC404HD Linux set up (+Roland RD-88)

This is the implementation of what is explained at https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PulseAudio/Examples#The_shell_script_method with
specific adaptations related to the Behringer UMC404HD interface. 

Everything there has been tested on UbuntuStudio 21.04 with 4 inputs and an midi controller plugged with MIDI cable straight into the
interface.

Also, this setup works with MIDI coming through USB, and audio signal coming from USB. That means that if you plug a Scene Piano like Roland RD-88, you'll get everything working : MIDI and Direct Audio.

As I have gone though many questions related to that kind of setting, feel free to ask questions.
